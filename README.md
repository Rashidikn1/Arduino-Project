# Arduino-Project
Radar that detects the objects infront of it and the distance the object is away from the sensor. Was inspired by Dejan Nedelkovski's
code.

Components:

1)hc sr04 - The ultrasonic distance sensor I used.

2)micro servo sg90 - Servo Motor. I attached distance sensor on the micro servo motor kit.

3)solderless breadboard.

4)arduino uno.

5)Male to Male jumper wires.
